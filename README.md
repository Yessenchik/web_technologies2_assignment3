# Assignment 3 — Flexbox & Grid (Starter Project)

This project implements each task from the assignment:

- **Task 0 (Flexbox Navigation):** Sticky header with logo left, links right, vertical centering, and spacing.
- **Task 1 (Card Row):** Three equal-height cards in a row, gaps, and hover effect.
- **Task 2 (Grid Areas):** Header, sidebar (left), main (right), footer spanning bottom using CSS Grid areas.
- **Task 3 (Image Gallery):** 3×3 grid with gaps and caption overlay on hover.
- **Task 4 (Portfolio):** Combined layout — header uses Flexbox, main uses Grid; project *cards* use Flexbox internally; footer spans full width.

## How to run
1. Unzip the archive.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Take screenshots for your report.

## Where to add your details
- Replace **YourLogo**, contact, and any placeholder text in `index.html`.
- Put your **name** and **group** into your report file.

## Notes
- All images are local SVG placeholders in `images/` to satisfy the “at least 9 images” requirement.
- The layout is responsive; reduce width to see cards and grids stack.
